                <p class="description">
                    At Trimble I am on the construction management software platform team! I am learning
                    a lot about observability, cloud infra, and infrastructure as code through Terraform.
                    They are on Azure so I am thankful to be exposed to that cloud provider, as it seems pretty popular.
                    One thing I've noticed / learned from my team is they are really careful with access controls.
                    People / entities are given the minimum of access required to function, so that if it were to be compromised, it minimizes
                    the potential harm.

                <h2>Software Engineer Intern - Apex Fintech Solutions</h2>
                <time class="date">January 2024 - July 2024</time>
                <p class="description">
                    When I was working on the ACATS team which dealt with creating the system to facilitate account transfers.
                    So for example if you changed 401k providers, you would initiate an ACATS to trasnfer the securities and cash from your
                    previous account to your new account. This way you won't execute a liquidation event that you will need to pay taxes on.
                    This was my first introduction to how a software engineering team operates, as well as a tech stack in general. They are on GCP and I was
                    primarily working with Golang.
