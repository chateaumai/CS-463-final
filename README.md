# The headers will be the commit / session

### Initial commit
My first commit was me getting the overall skeleton structure of the page down.
Sometimes I have troubles with a blank canvas so I started by stealing the about section
from the homework and putting that into my site.

I am going for a retro themed site that I would see when I was younger.
Something like 90s / early 2000s, except I wasn't technically born in the 90s.

Making sure that I try to use semantic html, rather than divs for everything - as that is something
I took away from this class

### work p tags 
The commit message for this session is kind of bad but here I am writing a small summary for my work experiences, at this point I was still trying to figure out what the rest of my site should look like / what javascript I will use

### projects and work experience
Here I probably should have seperated it into two different commits, but I doubled down on my theming adding some gifs to the screen. I also added the projects sections.
I had to write a lot more CSS for this and I got lazy during it. For example i wanted to format the images a bit differently for my two projects but instead of figuring out the css for the same class, I just made two classes.

But I am enjoying my theme so far, I have a nice yellow for the shadow of the headers and it reminds me of old movie subtitles - maybe hong kong noir a bit.
